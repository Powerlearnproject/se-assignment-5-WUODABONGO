2.	Context Awareness:
o	The integrated terminal opens in the context of your project’s root directory by default, making it easier to run project-specific commands.
o	It supports multiple profiles (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash, etc.), and you can configure and switch between them based on your needs.
3.	Efficiency:
o	Reduces the need to context switch between different applications, saving time and cognitive load.
o	Allows for quick testing and debugging by providing immediate feedback within the same interface.
4.	Customization:
o	You can customize the terminal’s appearance and behavior through VS Code settings (e.g., color themes, font size, line height).
o	Environment variables and shell profiles can be configured to suit your development needs.
5.	Integration with Extensions:
o	Some VS Code extensions enhance the functionality of the integrated terminal (e.g., terminal runners, task runners).
o	Direct integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) allows you to perform version control tasks more efficiently.
6.	Multitasking:
o	You can open multiple terminal instances and split terminals within the same window, allowing you to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
o	Terminal tabs and panes help organize different command-line tasks in a single workspace.
7.	Persistent Sessions:
o	Terminal sessions persist across editor restarts, allowing you to pick up where you left off without losing your terminal state.

4.	Variables:
o	Inspect variables in the current scope.
o	Modify variable values at runtime for testing and debugging purposes.
5.	Debug Console:
o	Execute arbitrary commands and expressions in the context of the paused debug session.
o	Useful for testing hypotheses and making temporary code changes without altering the source file.
6.	Step Controls:
o	Continue (F5): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint or end of the program.
o	Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code but don’t step into function calls.
o	Step Into (F11): Step into the function call on the current line.
o	Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function to the calling function.
7.	Inline Values:
o	Shows variable values inline with the code as you step through it.
o	Helps you quickly see the state of variables without needing to refer to the variables pane.
8.	Exception Handling:
o	Configure VS Code to break on handled or unhandled exceptions.
o	Provides insights into errors and helps in diagnosing issues.
